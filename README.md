This is one of my pet projects that creates images.

Once you've run the 'main.go' or Docker 'image' file at http://localhost/8080/list, you'll be
able to see the different versions of the images that have been generated. If you click on an
image, it'll open a link to the new image at http://localhost:8080/image/:generator.
At http://localhost:8080/new/:generator, you can get the ID of the image and the URL  where you
can get this image in the future. All the images in the current version are saved in the 'results' folder.
